        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p><img src="assets/images/LinkedinPic.jpg" alt="" class="image-bio">My name is Emanuel but alot of people
            call
            me E-Man. I'm a fan of comedy, and music.
            I like to do podcasts and you can hear my podcasts <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jayhawk-live">here.</a>
            Also I really like soccer and since I'm trying to fill up this and hoping that
            this text wraps around the bottom of my image, I'll tell you more about the
            soccer teams I like. Boca Juniors is my ride or die team and they're from Buenos Aires.
            Currently they're playing the Copa Libertadores tournament as well as their national tournament.
            Copa Libertadores is the same as the champions league, which happens in Europe.
            Copa Lib, as I like to call it goes down in South America. While many fall in love
            with the glitz and glamour of Champions League, Copa Lib provides a brutal
            tournament where you'll see much rougher play and alot more controversy.
            Also Copa Lib will provide you a glimpse at the future European stars of tomorrow.
            From the likes of Neymar, Falcao, and recently transfered Arthur you can see
            the South American stars that will be future European superstars. Boca Plays
            this week against a team called Palmeiras from Brazil and they are probably
            going to lose.
